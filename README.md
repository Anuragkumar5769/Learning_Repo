## Steps to follow

-   [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo to create your own copy of this repo in your GitHub account. Your own copy means that you will be able to contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository.
-   [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the forked repo to your local machine.
-   Create a new branch.
-   Create a **cpp** or **python** solution for palindrome check of a number and save that file by `yourName_palindrome.py` or `yourName_palindrome.cpp` inside the directory named **docs**.
-   Now check for `git status`. You will not find your save file, suprised?? try looking about GitIgnore.
-   Do whatever needed, push that file inside docs folder to your forked repo under new branch name.

### Those who know the short-cut apply, but you guys have to create a .md file inside docs folder only so that your friends and me also know how much cool git is.

## Happy Learning
